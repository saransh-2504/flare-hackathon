## 🎬 RECOMMENDED DEMO STRATEGY

### Create This Strategy:

```
Trigger Type: 📊 Price Movement (FTSO)
Asset: BTC
Condition: < 50000
Action: 🪙 Mint FAssets
Amount: 100
Safety Vault: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f4a8f
✅ Enable Security Firewall Protection
```

### Why This Strategy?

1. **Easy to Understand** - Everyone knows Bitcoin
2. **Shows FTSO** - Price monitoring
3. **Shows FAssets** - Cross-chain assets
4. **Shows Smart Accounts** - Gasless execution
5. **Shows Security** - Firewall protection
6. **Real Use Case** - DCA is popular

### What to Say:

"This is a Dollar Cost Averaging bot. It monitors Bitcoin price via FTSO - Flare's decentralized price oracle. When BTC drops below $50,000, it automatically buys $100 worth of Bitcoin FAssets. 

FAssets are trustless Bitcoin on Flare - no centralized bridge needed. The execution is completely gasless via Smart Accounts - users pay zero gas fees. 

And notice the security firewall checkbox - this strategy is protected. If our FDC monitoring detects any security threat from CertiK, PeckShield, or other security APIs, the circuit breaker activates instantly and pauses all protected strategies. Funds are automatically moved to the safety vault.

This is only possible on Flare because we use all 4 unique technologies: Smart Accounts, FDC, FTSO, and FAssets. No other blockchain has all four."
